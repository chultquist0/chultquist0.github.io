Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at UC Berkeley. My research focuses on experimental particle physics, and specifically interactions between Higgs Bosons and other particles. 

Outside of Physics, I am interested in crosswords, art, running, and shrimp. If you need a helpful mnemonic, you can always remember: CARS!
