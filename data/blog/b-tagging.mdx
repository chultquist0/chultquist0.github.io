# Some Background

## Jet Flavors

Protons are made of constituent particles called "quarks" and "gluons". When two we collide two protons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), these quarks and gluons collide to make more quarks and gluons which spray out into the detector. 
These quarks and gluons radiate more quarks and gluons, and create a spray of particles in some direction, and combine to form hadrons (particles like a proton that are made of quarks and gluons).

To study the underlying process of what happened in the initial proton collision, we often want to understand what type of quark initially created that jet. We call the different kind of quarks "flavors," and quarks come in 6 different varieties: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top.

Most commonly, we try to identify b-quarks. This is partically because physics involving b-quarks in all-the-rage these days, and partially because jets coming from b-quarks, or **b-jets**, are easy to identify!

# Putting your B-tagging Skills to the Test

I'll give you the tracks of 6 different jets, each a b-jet or a non-b-jet. Assign each jet a b-tagging score of 1-5, using a larger score to mean "more b-like". 
At the end, you'll be able to see how well you can separate a b-jet from a non-b-jet.
